**TASK-1:**
In this project, we will use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. We will explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and train a machine learning model to make predictions. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the survival of passengers based on the available features.

**TASK-2:**
The Iris flower dataset is a classic example of a multi-class classification problem, where the goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics. With three distinct species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica - this dataset provides an ideal platform for exploring various machine learning algorithms and techniques. In this project, we will develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species using their sepal and petal measurements.

**TASK-3:**
Sales prediction is a crucial aspect of business strategy, enabling companies to make informed decisions about inventory management, resource allocation, and marketing efforts. By accurately forecasting future sales, businesses can optimize their operations, reduce costs, and maximize revenue. In today's data-driven world, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for sales prediction, allowing companies to analyze complex data patterns and make accurate predictions.
